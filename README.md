# fa21-stat207-finalproject
Rehost of my final project for STAT 207, an analysis on game data from the Steam platform, using Python data-analysis packages and Jupyter notebook.

Detailed analysis with code can be seen in my [Jupyter Notebook.](https://github.com/afnanfdz/fa21-stat207-finalproject/blob/main/project_notebook.ipynb)

A more condensed summary of my findings can be seen on my [presentation slides](https://github.com/afnanfdz/fa21-stat207-finalproject/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Reception%20of%20PC%20Video%20Games%20through.pdf)
